## This repository contains some of my experimental ML projects:

* **Mammographic_Masses:** I applied *Multi Layer Perceptron (MLP)* to classify benign and malignant mamographic masses given certain medical attributes

* **IMDB_keras_MLP:**

* **StudentsAdmision@UCLA_MLP** In this project, we predict student admissions to graduate school at UCLA based on three pieces of data:
- GRE Scores (Test)
- GPA Scores (Grades)
- Class rank (1-4)
The dataset originally came from here: http://www.ats.ucla.edu/


* **IMDB_keras_RNN:**
